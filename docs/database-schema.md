# Database Schema Overview

This document describes the backend MySQL tables that power the colleague calendar application, as well as the supporting configuration and email infrastructure.

## Tables

### `users`
- Stores the core profile information for each account: name fields, email, company, location, shift preferences, avatar, and privacy flag (`info_hide`).
- Profile view and edit flows read and update these fields directly.
- New accounts are created by inserting a row with first name, last name, email, and a password hash. On login, the `user_id` and first name are stored in the session.
- Password reset relies on the `reset_token` and `reset_token_expiry` columns to keep track of recovery links; both fields are cleared once the password changes.

### `friends`
- Holds every confirmed colleague pair. Logged-in users query this table to populate their colleague list together with the relevant profile fields, respecting the `info_hide` privacy flag.
- Accepting a request moves the relationship from `friend_requests` into this table. Rejecting only changes the request status; removing a colleague deletes the pair here and tidies related requests so a new invitation can be sent later.

### `friend_requests`
- Tracks pending (`status = 0`), accepted (`status = 1`), and rejected (`status = 2`) invitations.
- When a new request is submitted the API ensures that neither an existing friendship nor another pending request already exists before inserting the row.
- Approval changes the status to `1` and creates the corresponding entry in `friends`; rejection sets the status to `2`. The table also powers counts and listings for incoming and outgoing requests, and lets senders cancel their outstanding invitations.
- Successful insertions trigger PHPMailer-based email notifications about the new request.

### `close_colleagues`
- Provides each user with a personal favourites list of colleagues using `user_id` and `colleague_id` pairs.
- API endpoints support retrieval, updates via `REPLACE`, and deletions so the UI can highlight "close" colleagues.

### `shift_deviations`
- Captures deviations from the standard shift rotation per user, including start date, number of work and off cycles, duration (in days), and whether to keep repeating the rhythm.
- CRUD endpoints are available for authenticated users to manage their own deviations.

### `remember_tokens`
- Stores hashes of "remember me" tokens together with the associated user and expiry timestamp.
- Tokens are created during logins where the user opts in to be remembered, restore the session on subsequent visits, and are refreshed or removed during logout.

## Configuration (`backend/config.php`)
- Every backend script that connects to MySQL requires `backend/config.php`, which returns credentials for `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS`. These combine with the host and database name for both `mysqli` and `PDO` connections across the backend.
- The same file exposes `MAIL_USER` and `MAIL_PASS`, ensuring each PHPMailer instance authenticates consistently. New scripts must continue to use `require __DIR__ . '/config.php';` instead of hard-coding credentials.

## Email via PHPMailer
- The PHPMailer library resides in `backend/PHPMailer/`, and scripts include the `src/` classes manually when sending emails.
- The contact/support form (`backend/send_mail.php`) delivers plain text emails to a fixed recipient using `MAIL_USER`/`MAIL_PASS` over SMTPS (server `cpanel02.dedia-server.no`, port `465`).
- The forgot-password flow generates a token, persists it on the user, and sends an HTML/plain-text reset link via the same SMTP connection.
- When a colleague request is sent, PHPMailer notifies the recipient with a styled HTML email, explicitly setting `CharSet` to `UTF-8` for Norwegian characters. Reuse this setup for any additional notifications to keep emails consistent.
